# ChatFilter
Tired of unwanted messages cluttering your chat? Getting messages you wouldn't want to see? This mod allows you to add custom filters for chat messages, making your gameplay experience cleaner and more enjoyable. It contains a placeholder for any online player, which makes it easy to hide player messages on servers using custom formatting.

# Current features:

- separate toggles to enable filtering player and server messages,
- custom message filters to hide any chat messages containing specific words or phrases,
- [ModMenu](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu/releases/tag/v9.2.0) integration for easy configuration,
- `<online>` placeholder that checks for any online player name.

# Requirements

It requires Fabric and [YetAnotherConfigLib](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/releases). While this mod was created for Minecraft 1.21, it might work on future versions.
